   - Temporary file + rename pattern prevents corruption
   - Comprehensive error handling and cleanup

4. **✅ CLI Security Integration**
   - Updated command-line argument validation
   - Security messaging in help text
   - Path validation for all config file parameters

5. **✅ Comprehensive Security Testing**
   - 15+ dedicated security test cases
   - Path traversal attack prevention validation
